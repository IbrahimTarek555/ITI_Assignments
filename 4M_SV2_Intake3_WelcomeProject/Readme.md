# ITI Welcoming Project

- This RC car is implemented using AVR ATMEGA32 microcontroller.
- there are 3 modes for this RC car: RemoteVehicle - LineFollower - AvoidingObstacles.
- Source code files are compressed into file "ITI_WelcomingProject.rar".
- Inside the compressed file, you will find the main function exists in 3 files extended by .txt. every file from them belongs to its corresponding application. when building, change the extend to .c and build all files together.
- there are three attached videos, every video belongs to an application.
